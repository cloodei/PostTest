    comment: "",
    ingredients: [
      "For the no-churn ice cream",
      "16 whole Oreos",
      "1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk",
      "1 3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract",
      "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",
      "2 cups (446g) cold heavy cream",

      "For building",
      "2 tablespoons milk (any kind, or heavy cream thinned with water)",
      "14 whole Oreos",
      "2/3 cup hot fudge topping",

      "For the crunchies",
      "10 whole Oreos",
      "Pinch kosher salt",
      "2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, melted",
      "1 tablespoon chocolate shell (optional)",

      "For the whipped cream",
      "1 1/2 cups cold heavy cream",
      "1/3 cup (40g) powdered sugar",
      "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
      "Pinch kosher salt",

      "For decorating",
      "3 tablespoons chocolate shell (optional), or as desired",
      "9 to 11 whole Oreos, or as desired",
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Prepare the pan: Line a round 8x3-inch springform pan with plastic wrap. Use one sheet of plastic wrap to cover the base of the pan and another longer sheet of plastic wrap to line the sides. Clasp the ring and base together and put the pan in the freezer while you make the ice cream.",

      "Make the no-churn ice cream: Place 6 Oreos in a resealable plastic bag, seal, and use a rolling pin to crush the Oreos into small pieces, no bigger than 1/4 to 1/2-inch. Set aside the Oreos and reserve the bag for later use. In a large bowl, stir together the sweetened condensed milk, vanilla extract, and salt to combine. In another large bowl, whip the cold heavy cream to stiff peaks using an electric hand mixer on medium speed, 3 to 4 1/2 minutes. Alternatively, you can use a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment.  Add 1/3 of the whipped cream to the bowl with the condensed milk mixture and fold in using a rubber spatula until almost fully combined. Fold in the remaining whipped cream in two additions until fully combined and there are no streaks. Spoon half of the ice cream into a separate bowl and set aside. This will be the vanilla layer. Fold in the crushed Oreos into the remaining ice cream. This will be the cookies and cream layer. Place the cookies and cream base into the fridge while you work on the bottom layers of the cake.",

      "Start building the cake: Remove the prepared pan from the freezer. Using a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon, spread a very thin layer of the vanilla ice cream, about 1/4 cup, over the bottom of the pan. Pour the milk into a small bowl. Working with one at a time, submerge each flat side of the 14 whole Oreos into the milk until soaked but not falling apart (about 6 seconds per side). Let the excess milk drip back into the bowl and place in a single layer on top of the thin layer of vanilla in the pan. Spoon any leftover milk over the Oreos and let fully absorb. Spoon the rest of the vanilla ice cream over the Oreos and smooth into an even layer. Transfer the pan back to the freezer and freeze until the surface is firm, 45 minutes to 75 minutes, depending on your freezer. It doesn't have to be solid all the way through, but firm enough that spreading fudge over the surface won't make it collapse.",

      "Make the crunchies: While the vanilla layer freezes, make the crunchies. Preheat the oven to 350°F with a rack set in the middle. Line a small rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the 10 Oreos in the resealable plastic bag, seal, and use a rolling pin to crush into fine, sandy crumbs. Alternatively, you can pulse the Oreos in a food processor. Transfer the crumbs to a medium bowl along with a pinch of kosher salt and the melted butter and toss until combined. Spread the Oreo mixture onto the baking sheet in an even layer and bake until fragrant and matte, about 8 minutes. The Oreo crumbs will be soft when they come out of the oven and firm as they cool. Let cool.If using the chocolate shell, transfer the crumbs to a bowl, breaking up any big clumps. Drizzle the chocolate shell over the crumbs and toss with a spoon until well coated. Set aside until you're ready to use.",

      "Prepare the fudge: The fudge needs to be easily spreadable, but not hot. If using store-bought fudge from a new jar, it likely won't need to be heated. Just take care to give it a good stir. If using fudge that has been refrigerated, reheat the fudge in the microwave in 5-second intervals, stirring between each, until the fudge is spreadable but not hot.",

      "Add the fudge and crunchies to the cake: Once the surface of the vanilla layer is firm, working quickly, remove the pan from the freezer. Use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the fudge in an even layer over the vanilla ice cream. Sprinkle the crunchies over the fudge. Return the pan to the freezer and chill until the layer of crunchies is firm, about 15 minutes. Tip I've found it to be super helpful to pipe the fudge in an even layer over the vanilla ice cream—a plastic bag with a corner cut off will do! The piped fudge won't completely cover the ice cream, but it makes spreading minimal, meaning you won't risk the ice cream melting and won't risk pushing the fudge into the vanilla layer.",

      "Finish building the cake: Remove the pan from the freezer and the cookies and cream ice cream from the refrigerator. Spoon the cookies and cream ice cream over the crunchies and use an offset spatula to spread it into an even layer. Cover the pan in plastic wrap, taking care not to create any dips in the ice cream. Return the pan to the freezer and freeze the cake until solid, at least 6 hours, but ideally overnight.",

      "Prepare your board, plate, or platter: If using a platter or plate to frost and decorate the cake on, refrigerate for 30 minutes, or if freezer space allows, freeze for 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can finish the cake on a 10-inch cardboard cake round.",

      "Make the whipped cream: When the cake is frozen solid and you're ready to decorate, prepare the whipped cream. Add the cold heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of kosher salt to a large bowl with a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip on medium speed until the cream is just about to reach stiff peaks, about 4 minutes. You should have about 3 cups. Reserve 1 cup for piping.",

      "Unmold the cake: Take the cake out of the freezer. Leave the top piece of plastic wrap laying on top of the cake (this will act as a barrier from the heat of your hand when you flip the cake). Unlock the clasp to release the ring from the base and remove the ring. Working quickly, with one hand under the base and one hand on top, flip the cake over, remove the base from the springform pan, peel the plastic wrap away, and flip it onto your cake board, plate, or platter. The vanilla and Oreo layer should be back on the bottom. Remove all the plastic wrap.",

      "Frost the cake: If you have one, place the cake on a turntable. Scoop the whipped cream onto the top of the cake and use an offset spatula to work the cream across the top and down over the sides. Use a bench scraper, offset spatula, or another straight-edged tool to scrape a thin layer of the whipped cream and smooth out the sides. For a bit of finesse, hold a small offset spatula or small spoon with the tip just touching the center of the top of the cake. With your other hand, continuously rotate the cake stand. As the cake stand is rotating, slowly start to pull the spatula back towards the edge of the cake through the whipped cream to create a spiral design. Carefully transfer the cake back to the freezer to firm up the whipped cream, about 15 minutes.",

      "Decorate the cake: Transfer the reserved whipped cream to a piping bag fitted with a 1/2-inch star tip. Finely crush 1 Oreo in the resealable bag with a rolling pin for sprinkling over the top border, if desired. If using chocolate shell, transfer it to a plastic piping bag or resealable plastic bag with a small opening cut from the tip. Remove the cake from the freezer. Using the piping bag with chocolate shell (or alternatively small spoonfuls), create the chocolate drips around the perimeter of the cake by carefully piping the chocolate around the edge and letting it drip and set. Use the piping bag filled with whipped cream to pipe large rosettes over the top border of the cake. Sprinkle the piped border with crushed Oreos and add the remaining 8 to 10 whole Oreos to the top as desired. Return the cake to the freezer for one final freeze for at least 20 minutes, or until solid. The finished, uncut cake can be stored in the freezer for 1 day uncovered until serving or a week covered. Leftover slices can be stored in an airtight container in the freezer for a week.",

    note: [
      "Chill time ranges from 8 to 10 hours, so plan ahead. Note that freezing times (such as the time to freeze the first layer of vanilla) can vary depending on how strong and full your freezer is.",

      "Store-bought ice cream can be used instead of the no-churn. Allow the ice cream to sit out at room temperature until scoopable, but not liquidy and melted. You will need 2 3/4 cups each store-bought vanilla ice cream and cookies and cream. Alternatively, you can fold crushed Oreos into vanilla ice cream to make a semi-homemade cookies and cream. ",

      "The chocolate shell coating the crunchies is optional, but cannot be substituted for something else. The chocolate shell used for decorating can, however, be substituted. You can use chocolate syrup/sauce, noting that it will not freeze on contact like chocolate shell, or melted chocolate, which will freeze immediately on contact.",

      "Beat the cream cheese and peanut butter: In a medium mixing bowl, beat the cream cheese with an electric hand mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. (Alternatively, use the paddle attachment on a stand mixer and beat the cream cheese at medium speed). Add 3/4 cup of powdered sugar and beat for 1 minute until smooth and incorporated. Add half of the peanut butter and beat until combined. Once incorporated add the remaining half. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.

      "Whip the cream: Pour the cream and vanilla extract into the chilled bowl. Beat on medium-high speed with an electric hand mixer (or stand mixer with a whisk attachment) until just before soft peaks form; the cream will have thickened slightly, but any peaks formed from lifting the whisk should immediately fall.",

      "Add the peanut butter mixture: Add half of the peanut butter mixture into the bowl, then whip on medium-high speed for a few seconds until mostly incorporated. Add the remaining half, then beat on medium-high speed until medium peaks form (any peaks should slightly curl at the tip). Be careful not to overmix here and check the consistency every 10 seconds. Once at medium peaks, finish whisking the mixture by hand until stiff peaks form. Use a spatula to fold in any unmixed traces of the peanut butter cream cheese.",

      "Assemble the cake: To assemble, place 7 to 8 chocolate wafer cookies in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Add about 1 cup of whipped cream, then drizzle some chocolate syrup over it. Repeat, layering with cookies, followed by the whipped cream and then the chocolate syrup. The cake should have about 6 layers. Once you've added the top layer of whipped cream, drizzle with the chocolate syrup, and garnish with peanut butter cups and any other desired toppings.",

      "Chill the cake: Place the cake uncovered in the fridge for at least 6 hours or until whipped cream has firmed up.",

Heat mixture over high heat, stirring constantly with a heatproof spatula. Once the mixture starts to bubble up, reduce the heat to low.

    ingredients: [
      "1 1/4 cups (250g) granulated sugar,",
      "1/4 cup water,",
      "6 large (95g) egg yolks, at room temperature,",
      "Pinch kosher salt,",
      "1 1/4 cups (255g) unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed into 1-tablespoon pieces,",
      "2 teaspoons vanilla extract.",
    ],
    instructions: [
      "Combine sugar and water: In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Once the mixture resembles melted sand, place it on the stovetop over medium heat. Use a wet pastry brush to brush down any stray sugar crystals around the rim and sides of the pot.",

      "Cook the sugar: Without stirring, bring the sugar mixture to a gentle boil and use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature. The sugar needs to reach 240°F (115°C). This should take no longer than 6 minutes.",

      "Whip the egg yolks: While the sugar comes to temperature, get to work on the egg yolks.",

      "Add egg yolks and salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk the yolks over medium speed until they are a very pale yellow color and fluffy, about 5 minutes.",

      "Decrease the mixer's speed to low and slowly stream sugar mixture into whipped egg yolks: Once the sugar has reached 240°F (115°C), add it to the whipping egg yolks. Pour the sugar in a thin, steady stream into the bowl taking care to avoid the sides of the bowl and the whisk.",

      "Continue to whisk the egg yolks and sugar mixture: After all of the sugar has been added, increase the mixer's speed to high and continue whipping the egg and sugar mixture until the outside of the bowl is just at room temperature. An excellent way to test this is to place the underside of your forearm against the bottom of the bowl. If it's no longer warm, you can begin adding the butter.",

      "Add the butter: Decrease the mixer's speed to medium-low, then begin adding the softened butter, a tablespoon at a time. I like to pinch the pats of butter before adding it to the bowl; this helps them blend into the egg mixture better. Allow each portion of butter to fully incorporate into the egg-sugar mixture before adding the next piece. The buttercream will go from very voluminous to deflated midway through adding butter. The volume will be restored once all of the butter has been added. This step should take no longer than 6 minutes.",

      "Add the vanilla extract: After the butter has been added, scrape down the bowl and add the vanilla extract. Turn the mixer back up to medium-high speed and whip the buttercream for 3 additional minutes.",

      "The buttercream should be an ivory color and will appear airy and fluffy.",

      "Store the buttercream: Use the buttercream as desired immediately or store for 3 to 4 days in a covered container in the refrigerat",

    instructions: [
      "Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.",

      "Add the eggs and vanilla: Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract and mix to combine, scraping down the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula. The mixture should be fluffy and light in color.",

      "Add the dry and wet ingredients: Alternate adding the flour mixture and the buttermilk, starting with half of the flour mixture, then all of the buttermilk, and finally the rest of the flour mixture. After each addition, mix on low speed just until combined. Pause and scrape the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed to ensure even mixing. The batter should be smooth and look like a thick chocolate cake batter.",

      "Scoop the batter: Scoop the batter with a 1-ounce cookie scoop, or if you are not using a cookie scoop roughly 2 tablespoons of batter per cake round. Drop the batter onto the prepared baking sheets leaving about 2 inches or space between each cake.",

      "Bake: Bake for 8 minutes, rotating the baking sheets halfway through (you'll need to bake the trays in batches). The tops of the cakes should look matte and spring back when gently poked. A toothpick inserted into the center of one of the middle cakes should come out clean or with only a few crumbs clinging to it.",

      "Cool: Let the cake cool on the trays for 5 minutes, then use a spatula to transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely before filling them.",

      "Make the filling: While the cakes cool, make the filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl with a hand mixer) beat the butter and confectioners' sugar on medium speed until pale and satiny, about 2 minutes. Add the marshmallow creme and vanilla extract and continue mixing until smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and mix again for 30 seconds to combine. The filling, while fluffy, will be slightly thicker than typical cake frosting.",

      "Assemble the whoopie pies; When the cakes are completely cool, assemble the whoopie pies. Spread or scoop about 2 tablespoons of the filling on the flat side of half of the cakes. Sandwich a second cake over the top.",

      "Store: Store the whoopie pies layered between sheets of wax paper or parchment paper in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days.",
