                  </p>
                  <p className="content-body">
                     First opened since 2008, Bakerz Bite has been striving to compete as an established bakery in the fast and crowded towns of New Orleans, keeping up with every clients' needs and comments, attending to every desires.
                  </p>
                  <p className="content-body">
                     Only until 2010 did we have the chance and raised enough funds in order to open up another establishment, all the way west to sunny California which we've struggled to compete there, and had to shut down the original establishment to build up our hopes with this one!
                  </p>
                  <p className="content-body">
                     After our fortunate and prudent investment, the dream was paid off and we were able to rise up as the #1 bakery in the West Coast, eventually opening up 3 more establishments within 2 years and expand across the nation.
